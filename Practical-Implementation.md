      <h2>Camera and Gate Doorbell</h2>
      <p>Here we can see the camera attached to the mailbox, along with the TCP wire used for communication between the relay and the gate controller.</p>

      <h2>Rasp and Relay circuit</h2>
      <p>Here we can see the internal connections, such as the TCP cable input to the relay, as well as its power and control cables plugged into the Raspberry, as well as the camera cable. Finally, this Raspberry is connected to the power supply using a USB-C cable and a plug adapter.</p>

      <h2>TV Box and Antenna</h2>
      <p><strong>The Antenna isn't commented during the project because usually it isn't needed, since TV Boxes usually have a built-in antenna. This one particularlly has a broken antenna, so in order to connect to any wi-fi network, 
      was necessary to make this adaptation</strong></p>
