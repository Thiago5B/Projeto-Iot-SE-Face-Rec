  <h1>Gate control</h1>
  <p>Since the gate is already locked by a eletronic device, the control itself is quite easy, the real difficulty is choosing automatically who can enter and who can't.</p>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <p>The list below describes the items involved and their use</p> 
      <li><strong>Camera</strong>: The camera model chosen in this project is a Logitech C92S, because it can record video in HD, altought the image seen by the microcontroller is limited to 480p, 
        so it consumes less processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Microcontroller</strong>: The Raspberry Pi 4 was chosen because it can run a individual OS, making the image capturing and processing easier.<br>
      The project was developed on the 4GB version of the board and using the Debian Linux adapted for Rasp, called Raspbian, as an OS.</li>
      <li><strong>Switch</strong>: The switch used to control the eletronic gate lock was a simples Relay module, .</li>
      <li><strong>Eletronic Lock</strong>: The locked used was the one already installed on our house, </li>
